## Model List

We provide a number of models that can be used out of the box. These models are available on the [HuggingFace hub](https://huggingface.co/collections/minishlab/model2vec-base-models-66fd9dd9b7c3b3c0f25ca90e) and can be loaded using the `from_pretrained` method. The models are listed below:
