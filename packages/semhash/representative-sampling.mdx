SemHash provides a simple interface for representative sampling, which is useful for selecting a subset of data that best represents the entire dataset.
This can be particularly useful in scenarios where you want to reduce the size of your dataset while retaining its diversity.

This works by first selecting samples that have the *highest average similarity* to other samples in the dataset (the most "central" samples),
and then iteratively selecting samples that are most dissimilar to the already selected ones with that set using *maximum marginal relevance (MMR)*.

## Representative Sampling from a Single Dataset
To perform representative sampling from a single dataset, you can use the `self_find_representative` method. This method will select a subset of samples that best represent the entire dataset based on their semantic similarity.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from semhash import SemHash

# Load a dataset to filter
texts = load_dataset("ag_news", split="train")["text"]

# Initialize a SemHash instance
semhash = SemHash.from_records(records=texts)

# Find representative samples from the texts
representative_texts = semhash.self_find_representative().selected
```


<Accordion title="Parameters">

    <ParamField
        path="selection_size"
        type="int"
        default="10"
    >
        Number of representatives to select.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="candidate_limit"
        type="int | Literal['auto']"
        default="auto"
    >
        Number of top candidates to consider for MMR reranking. Defaults to "auto", which calculates the limit based on the total number of records.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="lambda_param"
        type="float"
        default="0.5"
    >
        Trade-off parameter between relevance (1.0) and diversity (0.0). Must be between 0 and 1.
    </ParamField>

</Accordion>

## Representative Sampling Across Multiple Datasets
To perform representative sampling across multiple datasets, you can use the `find_representative` method. This method allows you to select a subset of samples from one dataset that best represents another dataset.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from semhash import SemHash
# Load two datasets to filter
train_texts = load_dataset("ag_news", split="train")["text"]
test_texts = load_dataset("ag_news", split="test")["text"]

# Initialize a SemHash instance with the training data
semhash = SemHash.from_records(records=train_texts)

# Find representative samples from the test data against the training data
representative_test_texts = semhash.find_representative(records=test_texts).selected
```
<Accordion title="Parameters">
    <ParamField
        path="records"
        type="Sequence[Record]"
    >
        The new set of records (e.g., a test set) to find representative samples with against the fitted dataset.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="selection_size"
        type="int"
        default="10"
    >
        Number of representatives to select.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="candidate_limit"
        type="int | Literal['auto']"
        default="auto"
    >
        Number of top candidates to consider for MMR reranking. Defaults to "auto", which calculates the limit based on the total number of records.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="lambda_param"
        type="float"
        default="0.5"
    >
        Trade-off parameter between relevance (1.0) and diversity (0.0). Must be between 0 and 1.
    </ParamField>   
</Accordion>

## Representative Sampling from a Multi-Column Dataset
If you have a multi-column dataset, you can sample representatives from it by specifying the columns to use for representative sampling.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from semhash import SemHash

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("squad_v2", split="train")

# Convert the dataset to a list of dictionaries
records = [dict(row) for row in dataset]

# Initialize SemHash with the columns to deduplicate
semhash = SemHash.from_records(records=records, columns=["question", "context"])

# Find representative samples from the records
representative_records = semhash.self_find_representative().selected
```
