Vicinity can be used to build and query a vector store. It provides a unified interface for various approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) backends, allowing you to easily switch between them and compare their performance.

## Building a Vector Store
To build a vector store with Vicinity, you can use the `Vicinity.from_vectors_and_items` method. This method allows you to create a vector store from a set of vectors and their corresponding items.
For this example, we will use some dummy data, but you can replace it with your own vectors and items.

```python
import numpy as np
from vicinity import Vicinity

# Create some dummy data as strings or other serializable objects
items = ["triforce", "master sword", "hylian shield", "boomerang", "hookshot"]
vectors = np.random.rand(len(items), 128)

# Initialize the Vicinity instance (using the basic backend and cosine metric)
vicinity = Vicinity.from_vectors_and_items(
    vectors=vectors,
    items=items,
)
```

<Accordion title="Parameters">

    <ParamField
        path="vectors"
        type="npt.NDArray"
    >
        The vectors to use.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="items"
        type="Sequence[Any]"
    >
        The items to use.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="backend_type"
        type="Backend | str"
        default="Backend.BASIC"
    >
        The type of backend to use.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="store_vectors"
        type="bool"
        default="False"
    >
        Whether to store the raw vectors in the backend.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="kwargs"
        type="Any"
    >
        Additional arguments to pass to the backend.
    </ParamField>

</Accordion>

There are two important parameters here:
- `backend_type`: This specifies the type of backend to use. You can choose from various backends like `Backend.BASIC` (default), `Backend.FAISS`, etc. Each backend has its own strengths and weaknesses. 
View the full list of backends in the [supported backends](supported-backends) documentation.
- `metric`: This specifies the distance metric to use for querying. You can choose from various metrics like `Metric.COSINE` (default), `Metric.EUCLIDEAN`, etc.
Which metrics are supported depends on the backend you choose.

Note that most backends have their own parameters that can be configured.
These can be passed as additional keyword arguments.
For a full list of parameters for each backend, see the [supported backends](supported-backends) documentation.

For example, if you want to use the FAISS backend with the HNSW algorithm and Euclidean metric, you can do it like this:

```python
from vicinity import Vicinity, Backend, Metric
vicinity = Vicinity.from_vectors_and_items(
    vectors=vectors,
    items=items,
    backend_type=Backend.FAISS,
    index_type="hnsw",
    metric=Metric.EUCLIDEAN
)
``` 

## Querying a Vector Store

To query a vector store, you can use the `query` and `query_threshold` methods. This allows you to find the nearest neighbors of a given query vector or a list of query vectors.
Both methods support both single and batch queries.


### Query Top-K Nearest Neighbors

```python
# Create a query vector
query_vector = np.random.rand(128)

# Query for nearest neighbors with a top-k search
results = vicinity.query(query_vector, k=3)
```

<Accordion title="Parameters">

    <ParamField
        path="vectors"
        type="npt.NDArray"
    >
        The vectors to find the nearest neighbors to.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="k"
        type="int"
        default="10"
    >
        The number of most similar items to retrieve.
    </ParamField>

</Accordion>

### Query with a Threshold

```python
# Create a query vector
query_vector = np.random.rand(128)

# Query for nearest neighbors with a threshold search
results = vicinity.query_threshold(query_vector, threshold=0.9)
```

<Accordion title="Parameters">

    <ParamField
        path="vectors"
        type="npt.NDArray"
    >
        The vectors to find the most similar vectors to.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="threshold"
        type="float"
        default="0.5"
    >
        The threshold to use.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="max_k"
        type="int"
        default="100"
    >
        The maximum number of neighbors to consider for the threshold query.
    </ParamField>

</Accordion>

## Saving and Loading a Vector Store
You can save and load a vector store using the `save` and `load` methods. This allows you to persist your vector store to disk and load it later.

```python
vicinity.save('my_vector_store')
vicinity = Vicinity.load('my_vector_store')
```


## Pushing and Loading to/from Hugging Face Hub

You can push and load a vector store to/from the Hugging Face Hub using the `push_to_hub` and `from_pretrained` methods. This allows you to easily share your vector store with others.

```python
vicinity.push_to_hub(repo_id='minishlab/my-vicinity-repo')
vicinity = Vicinity.load_from_hub(repo_id='minishlab/my-vicinity-repo')
```

<Accordion title="push_to_hub parameters">

    <ParamField
        path="repo_id"
        type="str"
    >
        The repository ID on the Hugging Face Hub.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="token"
        type="str | None"
        default="None"
    >
        Optional authentication token for private repositories. If not provided, your default Hugging Face credentials are used.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="private"
        type="bool"
        default="False"
    >
        Whether to create the repository as private.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="kwargs"
        type="Any"
    >
        Additional arguments passed to `Dataset.push_to_hub()`.
    </ParamField>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="load_from_hub parameters">

    <ParamField
        path="repo_id"
        type="str"
    >
        The repository ID on the Hugging Face Hub.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="token"
        type="str | None"
        default="None"
    >
        Optional authentication token for private repositories. If not provided, your default Hugging Face credentials are used.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="kwargs"
        type="Any"
    >
        Additional arguments passed to `Dataset.load_from_hub()`.
    </ParamField>

## Evaluate a Vector Store
You can evaluate a vector store using the `evaluate` method. This method computes the recall and queries per second of the vector store based on a set of queries and their expected results.

```python
# Use the first 1000 vectors as query vectors
query_vectors = vectors[:1000]

# Evaluate the Vicinity instance by measuring the queries per second and recall
qps, recall = vicinity.evaluate(
    full_vectors=vectors,
    query_vectors=query_vectors,
)
```

    <ParamField
        path="full_vectors"
        type="npt.NDArray"
    >
        The full dataset vectors used to build the index.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="query_vectors"
        type="npt.NDArray"
    >
        The query vectors to evaluate.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="k"
        type="int"
        default="10"
    >
        The number of nearest neighbors to retrieve.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField
        path="epsilon"
        type="float"
        default="1e-3"
    >
