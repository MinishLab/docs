**Hello, we're Minish!**

We're a two-person ([pringled](https://github.com/Pringled) and [stephantul](https://github.com/stephantul)) open-source lab, with a 
focus on building small, efficient, and effective models for natural language processing. Our goal is to make state-of-the-art NLP accessible to everyone, regardless of their resources or expertise.
  We believe that if you make models fast enough, you unlock new possibilities.

Using our software, you can:
* Embed the entire English Wikipedia in 5 minutes
* Classify tens of thousands of documents per second on a CPU
* Approximately deduplicate extremely large datasets in minutes
* Build the fastest RAG application in the world
* Easily evaluate which ANN algorithm works best for your data
